# itvibe-template

A full-stack TypeScript monorepo template: a Vue 3 frontend, a high-performance
uWebSockets.js backend, and a shared package for contracts (schemas, enums,
guards, responses) reused on both sides of the wire.

The repository is organized as a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) workspace with
type-safe end-to-end contracts shared between the frontend and backend.

## What it's good for

This template is built for **quickly bootstrapping production-ready SPA
applications**. Instead of wiring up the same foundation on every new project,
you start from a working full-stack app that already ships the features most
products need on day one:

- **Authentication out of the box** — sign in via email, phone number (SMS), and
  social providers, with sessions, CSRF protection, and throttling already in
  place.
- **Real-time by default** — a configured WebSocket layer (uWebSockets.js) for
  live updates, presence, and bidirectional messaging.
- **Push notifications** — server-side delivery of web push notifications to
  connected clients.
- **Installable PWA** — the Vue 3 frontend is preconfigured as a Progressive Web
  App, so users can install it and use it offline.
- **And more** — file storage (S3/MinIO), transactional/auth email, i18n,
  AI provider integrations, error monitoring, and an end-to-end type-safe
  contract layer shared between frontend and backend.

Because the plumbing is already done, you can focus on your product's actual
features from the first commit.

### Best suited for

- SaaS dashboards and account-based products
- Admin panels with real-time user activity
- PWA products with auth, push notifications, and offline support
- Apps that need shared frontend/backend contracts from day one
- Products with AI-assisted support or knowledge-base workflows
- **Backend-only / API services** — you can drop the `frontend` package entirely,
  turn off static serving (`SERVE_STATIC=false`) and session/CSRF handling, and
  run just the backend with `api-playground` for convenient manual API testing

### Probably overkill for

- Static landing pages
- Serverless-first edge applications
- Projects that do not need auth, a database, or real-time features

## Ready-made product flows

Beyond the technology list, the template ships working user-facing flows you can
build on (or strip out):

- Email registration, email verification, login, logout, logout-all, change /
  reset password (including a one-time-token reset flow)
- Optional phone-based auth (register / confirm / complete profile) plus phone
  and email linking to an existing account
- OAuth redirect/callback foundation (`auth/oauth/:provider/redirect` and
  `/callback`)
- User account page with profile and avatar upload/management
- Push notification subscription management plus a "send test push" endpoint
- Admin area for users, online users, online history, and the knowledge base
- AI-backed support chat with chat history and knowledge-base articles
- API playground for manual HTTP/WebSocket testing

### Local services

| Service                                   | Required?                  | Used for                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **PostgreSQL**                            | Required                   | Primary database (Drizzle ORM)             |
| **Redis**                                 | Required for auth/realtime | Sessions, WebSocket coordination, presence |
| **S3 / MinIO**                            | Required for storage flows | File upload / object storage               |
| **SMTP**                                  | Optional                   | Transactional / auth email                 |
| **Sentry**                                | Optional                   | Error & performance monitoring             |
| **AI providers** (OpenAI / Mistral / xAI) | Optional                   | AI features                                |
| **Telegram**                              | Optional                   | Bot notifications                          |

To boot the database layer you need **PostgreSQL**; **Redis** is required as soon
as you exercise full auth/realtime behavior (sessions, WebSocket, presence). The
remaining services are optional and unlock the corresponding feature areas as you
enable them.

### Feature prerequisites

Which optional service / env each feature needs:

| Feature                             | Requires                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Email verification / password reset | `SMTP_*` settings (`SMTP_ENABLED=true`)       |
| Phone auth                          | `AUTH_PHONE_ENABLED=true` and an SMS provider |

The backend follows a layered architecture: `repository → transformer →
service → controller → route`, with shared schemas defining the request/response
contracts. See `AGENTS.md` for the full conventions.

## Architecture at a glance

The frontend and backend speak over HTTP + WebSocket and share a single
contract package, so request/response shapes are type-checked on both sides:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Frontend[Vue 3 SPA / PWA] -->|HTTP + WebSocket| Backend[uWebSockets.js backend]
  Frontend --> Shared[shared schemas/responses]
  Backend --> Shared
  Backend --> Postgres[(PostgreSQL)]
  Backend --> Redis[(Redis)]
  Backend --> S3[S3 / MinIO]
  Backend --> SMTP[SMTP]
  Backend --> AI[AI providers]
  Backend --> Sentry[Sentry]
```

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Configure the backend environment
cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
# then edit packages/backend/.env (DATABASE_URL, APP_KEY, S3_*, etc.)

# 3. Build shared, then run backend + frontend dev servers in parallel
pnpm dev
```

### Minimal `.env` for local development

`packages/backend/.env.example` lists every available setting. To get the app
running locally you really only need a few of them:

```dotenv
APP_KEY=at-least-32-characters-local-secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
LANDING_URL=http://localhost:5173

# PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@127.0.0.1:5432/itvibe_template
DB_CONNECTION=pg
PGSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
PGSQL_PORT=5432
PGSQL_USER=postgres
PGSQL_PASSWORD=password
PGSQL_DB_NAME=itvibe_template

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_PREFIX=uwebsocket:
```

Everything else (S3/MinIO, SMTP, Sentry, AI, Telegram, CSRF/CORS hardening) is
opt-in — enable it when you start using the corresponding feature.

### Development workflow

A typical human-friendly loop:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:shared   # shared contracts must be built before backend/frontend
pnpm dev            # run backend + frontend together

pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

Before opening a PR, run the full verification chain with `./init.sh`
(`install → typecheck → lint → test → build`) to confirm a clean checkout:

```bash
./init.sh
```

| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`                               | Build `shared` + `backend`, then run backend and frontend dev servers in parallel |
| `pnpm dev:backend` / `pnpm dev:frontend` | Run a single package in dev mode                                                  |
| `pnpm build`                             | Build every package recursively                                                   |
| `pnpm build:shared`                      | Build only the `shared` package                                                   |
| `pnpm start`                             | Start the built backend (`node dist/index.js`)                                    |
| `pnpm typecheck`                         | TypeScript checks across all packages                                             |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix`            | Lint (and auto-fix) the whole repo with ESLint                                    |

| `pnpm test`                              | Run all package test suites                                                       |
| `pnpm clean`                             | Clean build artifacts and `node_modules`                                          |

Frontend e2e tests use Playwright:

```bash
pnpm --filter frontend test:e2e
```

### Manual API testing

The `api-playground` package is a Vue dev tool for exercising the backend's
HTTP and WebSocket endpoints by hand. Run it alongside the backend with:

```bash
pnpm dev:manual_test   # builds shared, then runs backend + API playground in parallel
```

The playground is then available at http://localhost:5174.

## Database (backend)

The backend uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) against PostgreSQL.
Useful package-level scripts (run from `packages/backend`):

```bash
pnpm db:create     # create the database
pnpm db:generate   # generate migrations from schema
pnpm db:migrate    # apply migrations
pnpm db:seed       # run the seed script
pnpm db:studio     # open Drizzle Studio
```

> `pnpm db:seed` is a hook reserved for project-specific seed data. The template
> does not ship default demo users or fixtures — add your own in
> `packages/backend/src/db/seed.ts`.

## Configuration

All backend configuration is environment-driven. Use
`packages/backend/.env.example` as the reference — it documents settings for the
app, CORS/CSRF, proxy trust, phone/email auth, database, S3 storage, mail,
Telegram, Sentry, Redis, and AI providers. The frontend reads `VITE_*` variables
(see `packages/frontend/.env.example`).

> **Do not commit secrets.** Treat auth, storage, mail, AI, and database
> settings as environment-specific.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

A Content-Security-Policy is pre-defined in
`packages/backend/src/config/csp.ts` as a directives map, so you tune the policy
in one place instead of hand-writing a header string:

- `enabled` / `reportOnly` — master switch and a report-only mode for safe
  rollout (observe violations before enforcing).
- `directives` — `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`,
  `font-src`, `connect-src`, `frame-ancestors`, `object-src`, `base-uri`, …
- `connect-src` is environment-aware: stricter (`wss:`/`https:`) in production,
  relaxed (`ws:`/`http:`) locally so dev tooling and the WebSocket connection
  work out of the box.

The policy is meant to be emitted on HTML responses from the static server
(`packages/backend/src/vendor/start/static-server.ts`). The header-emitting code
there is currently shipped commented-out (opt-in) — uncomment `buildCspValue` /
`setCspHeader` to start sending the header, and roll it out with `reportOnly:
true` first. Remember to add your real CDN/S3 and API origins to `img-src` /
`connect-src` before enforcing.

## Starting a new product from this template

When you fork this template into a real product, work through:

- [ ] Rename package/app branding (names, titles, manifest, metadata)
- [ ] Replace the default legal/policy pages (privacy, terms, cookies, AI policy)
- [ ] Configure the `.env` files (backend and frontend)
- [ ] Create and migrate the database (`pnpm --filter backend db:create db:migrate`)
- [ ] Decide which optional integrations to enable (SMTP, S3, push, AI, Sentry)
- [ ] Replace the demo/support knowledge-base content
- [ ] Configure production CORS, CSRF, CSP, proxy trust, cookies, and Sentry
- [ ] Run `./init.sh` to confirm a clean install → typecheck → lint → test → build

## Building for production

The multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds `shared`, then `frontend`, then `backend`,
copies the compiled frontend into the backend's `public/` directory, and runs
migrations on startup:

```bash
docker build -t itvibe-template .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file packages/backend/.env itvibe-template
```

The container entrypoint runs `pnpm db:create && pnpm db:migrate && pnpm start`.

### Production / security checklist

Before deploying, make sure you have:

- [ ] Set a strong, unique `APP_KEY`
- [ ] Set `APP_IS_PRODUCTION=true`
- [ ] Enabled `TRUST_PROXY` **only** behind a trusted reverse proxy / load balancer
      (and set `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` accordingly)
- [ ] Disabled the fake SMS provider (`AUTH_SMS_PROVIDER_ALLOW_FAKE=false`)
- [ ] Configured `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for your real frontend origin(s)
- [ ] Enabled `CSRF_ENFORCE=true` — after first validating in report-only mode
- [ ] Reviewed the CSP in `config/csp.ts` (add your CDN/S3 + API origins) and
      enabled the header in the static server — roll out with `reportOnly: true`

## Workflow & conventions

This template is set up for coordinated multi-developer (and AI agent) work.
`feature_list.json` on `main` is the single source of truth for who owns which
feature; per-feature `progress.md` and `session-handoff.md` live on feature
branches. Read **`AGENTS.md`** for the full startup workflow, Definition of
Done, coding style, and testing guidelines before contributing.

| Backend won't start        | `APP_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` are set in `packages/backend/.env`, and PostgreSQL is reachable                                   |
| E2E tests fail             | Make sure frontend and backend are running (`pnpm dev`) before `pnpm --filter frontend test:e2e`                               |
| Drizzle / migration errors | Verify the database settings in `packages/backend/.env` (`DATABASE_URL` / `PGSQL_*`) and that the DB exists (`pnpm db:create`) |
